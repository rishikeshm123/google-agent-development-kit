# Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) Exploration

---

## About This Repo

This repo serves as a **sandbox for working with ADK-based agents**.  
You’ll find:
- Setup instructions and environment management
- Example agent workflows and experiments
- Exploration of ADK features like scheduling, orchestration, and multi-agent interactions

Ideal for developers who want to understand **how agents can be structured, extended, and deployed** with Google’s ADK.

---

## Next Steps

- Run the sample experiments
- Modify agent blueprints
- Explore multi-agent collaboration scenarios

This repository is dedicated to experimenting with and exploring the functionality of the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.  
The goal is to understand how ADK enables building, orchestrating, and deploying **agent-based systems**, with hands-on examples and experiments.

## Environment Setup

You only need to create **one virtual environment** in the root directory for all the examples in this course.

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

python -m venv .venv

### 2. Activate Virtual Environment (run this every new terminal session)

- **macOS/Linux**
source .venv/bin/activate

- **Windows (CMD)**
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

- **Windows (PowerShell)**
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

### 3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
